## `leo add`
[Back to Top](#commands)

The `leo add` command is used to add a new on-chain or local dependency to the current Leo project.


To add a local dependency to your project, run the following command:
```bash
leo add --local <LOCAL> <NAME>
```
where `<NAME>` is the name of the imported program, and `<LOCAL>` is the path to the local project.

&nbsp;

#### `--edition <EDITION> `
#### `-e <EDITION>`
Specifies the expected edition of the program being imported. Only passing this flag will assume that the program is being imported from the network.

## `leo build`

[Back to Top](#commands)

To compile your program into Aleo instructions and verify that it builds properly, run:
```bash
leo build
```
 
On invoking the build command, Leo automatically creates a `build/‚Å†` and `output/`‚Å† folder in the project directory. The compiled `.aleo` file is contained in the `build` directory. The `output` directory is used to stored intermediate artifacts from compilation. 

```bash title="console output:"
  Leo     2 statements before dead code elimination.
  Leo     2 statements after dead code elimination.
  Leo     The program checksum is: '[...]'.
  Leo ‚úÖ Compiled '{PROGRAM_NAME}.aleo' into Aleo instructions.
```

### Flags:
```
--offline
    Enables offline mode.
--enable-ast-spans
    Enable spans in AST snapshots.
--enable-dce

--network <NETWORK>
    The network to deploy to. Overrides the `NETWORK` environment variable.
--endpoint <ENDPOINT>
    The endpoint to deploy to. Overrides the `ENDPOINT` environment variable.
--devnet
    Whether the network is a devnet. If not set, defaults to the `DEVNET` environment variable.

## `leo debug`
[Back to Top](#commands)

This is the Leo Interpreter. Try the command `#help`.

? Command? ‚Ä∫ 
```

### Cheatsheet

<!--TODO: Rewrite this cheatsheet to present the information in a more condensed form.-->

```
You probably want to start by running a function or transition.
For instance
#into program.aleo/main()
Once a function is running, commands include
#into    to evaluate into the next expression or statement;
#step    to take one step towards evaluating the current expression or statement;
#over    to complete evaluating the current expression or statement;
#run     to finish evaluating
#quit    to quit the interpreter.

You can set a breakpoint with
#break program_name line_number

When executing Aleo VM code, you can print the value of a register like this:
#print 2

Some of the commands may be run with one letter abbreviations, such as #i.

Note that this interpreter is not line oriented as in many common debuggers;
rather it is oriented around expressions and statements.
As you step into code, individual expressions or statements will
be evaluated one by one, including arguments of function calls.

You may simply enter Leo expressions or statements on the command line
to evaluate. For instance, if you want to see the value of a variable w:
w
If you want to set w to a new value:
w = z + 2u8;

Note that statements (like the assignment above) must end with a semicolon.

If there are futures available to be executed, they will be listed by
numerical index, and you may run them using `#future` (or `#f`); for instance
#future 0

The interpreter begins in a global context, not in any Leo program. You can set
the current program with

#set_program program_name

This allows you to refer to structs and other items in the indicated program.

The interpreter may enter an invalid state, often due to Leo code entered at the
REPL. In this case, you may use the command

#restore

Which will restore to the last saved state of the interpreter. Any time you
enter Leo code at the prompt, interpreter state is saved.

Input history is available - use the up and down arrow keys.
```

See [Debugging](./guides/08_debugging.md) for more details.

## `leo run`

Use this command to run your program before [**executing**](#leo-execute) it.

To run a Leo transition function with inputs from the command line, run the following command:
```bash
leo run <TRANSITION_NAME> <INPUTS>
```

where `<TRANSITION_NAME>` is the name of the `transition` or `async transition` function to run and `<INPUTS>` is a list of inputs to the program separated by spaces.

This command does not synthesize the program circuit or generate proving and verifying keys.

```bash title="sample output:"
       Leo     ... statements before dead code elimination.
       Leo     ... statements after dead code elimination.
       Leo     The program checksum is: '[...]'.
       Leo ‚úÖ Compiled '{PROGRAM_NAME}.aleo' into Aleo instructions.

 ‚Ä¢  '{PROGRAM_NAME}.aleo/{FUNCTION_NAME}' - ... constraints (called 1 time)

‚û°Ô∏è  Outputs

 ‚Ä¢ {OUTPUT_0}
 ‚Ä¢ {OUTPUT_1}
 ...
```

If one or more of your inputs are negatives, and consequently begin with a `-`,
you may separate the inputs with a `--` so that the command line parser
won't attempt to parse them as options:
```bash
leo run <TRANSITION_NAME> -- <INPUT_0> -- <INPUT_1> ...
