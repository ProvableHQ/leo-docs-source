## `leo account`

[Back to Top](#commands)

To create a new Aleo account, run:

```bash
leo account new
```


```bash title="console output:"
  Private Key  APrivateKey1zkp...
     View Key  AViewKey1...
      Address  aleo1...
```

:::warning
We urge you to exercise caution when managing your private keys. `leo account` cannot be used to recover lost keys.
:::

To import an existing Aleo account, run:

```bash
leo account import <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

To create a new account and save it to your `.env` file, run:

```bash
leo account new --write
````

`leo account` has a number of additional subcommands. To list all options, run:

```bash
leo account --help
```

```bash title="console output:"

## `leo add`
[Back to Top](#commands)
:::tip
Use this command to add a dependency to your program. This is a precursor to being able to import a program inside the leo source code file. 
:::

The command can be used to add an already deployed program as a project dependency.
`<PROGRAM>` should be the name of the program to add as a dependency.
```bash
leo add <PROGRAM> // <NETWORK> defaults to `testnet`.
leo add -n <NETWORK> <PROGRAM> // To pull from a custom network. 
```

The command can be used to add a local Leo program as a project dependency.
`<PATH>` should be the relative path to the project directory.
```bash
leo add -l <PATH> <PROGRAM> 
```

See [Dependency Management](./04_dependencies.md) for more details.

&nbsp;

## `leo build`

[Back to Top](#commands)

To compile your program into Aleo Instructions and verify that it builds properly, run:
```bash
leo build
```

[//]: # (The results of compiling `main.leo` or `lib.leo` and it's imported dependencies will be printed:)

[//]: # (```bash title="console output:")

[//]: # ( Compiling Starting...)

[//]: # ( Compiling Compiling main program... &#40;"${NAME>/src/main.leo"&#41;)

[//]: # ( Compiling Complete)

[//]: # (      Done Finished in 10 milliseconds)

[//]: # (```)
This will populate the directory `build/` (creating it if it doesn't exist) with an Aleo instructions file `.aleo`.
```bash title="console output:"

```

&nbsp;

## `leo clean`
[Back to Top](#commands)

To clean the build directory, run:
```bash

```

See [Debugging](./../testing/02_debugger.md) for more details.

&nbsp;

## `leo deploy`
[Back to Top](#commands)
:::tip
Use this command to deploy a program to the Aleo network. This requires having a funded account. 
:::

To deploy the project in the current working directory.
```bash
leo deploy // Defaults to using key information in `.env`, and deploys to `testnet3` via endoint `http://api.explorer.provable.com/v1`.
leo deploy --endpoint "<ENDPOINT>" --private-key "<PRIVATE_KEY>" // To deploy using custom private key, to a custom endpoint (e.g. local devnet `http://0.0.0.0:3030`).
```

:::info
The `-b` or `--broadcast` flag is required in order to broadcast a transaction to a network.
:::

:::info

:::

See [Deploy](01_deploying.md) for more details.

&nbsp;

## `leo devnet`
[Back to Top](#commands)
:::tip
Use this command to initialize a local devnet
:::

:::info
The default ENDPOINT for a local devnet is `http://localhost:3030`
:::

To intialize a local devnet, run the following command:
```bash
leo devnet --snarkos <SNARKOS>
```
where `<SNARKOS>` should be the path to an installed binary of snarkOS.

If you don't have snarkOS installed, you can do so by passing the `--install` flag, which will install the binary at the path specified above.

### Optional Flags:

#### `--consensus-heights <CONSENSUS_HEIGHTS> `
Optional blocks heights to use for each successive consensus upgrade.  Must have `--snarkos-features test_network` enabled as well.

The following will enable Consensus_V0 at block 0, Consensus_V1 at block 1, etc.:
```bash
--consensus-heights 0,1,2,3....
```

#### `--storage <STORAGE>`
Root directory path for snarkOS ledgers and logs.  Defaults to `./`

#### `--clear-storage`
Clear existing snarkOS ledgers before starting the devnet


#### `--network <NETWORK>`
Specifies what the network ID of the devnet will be.

| ID |  Network  |
|:---------:|:------:|
| 0  | Mainnet | 
| 1  | Testnet (default)| 
| 2  | Canary | 

#### `--tmux`
Run devnet nodes in tmux (only available on Unix-based systems)

#### `--num-validators <NUM_VALIDATORS>`
Number of validators to use in snarkOS.  Defaults to 4.

#### `--num-clients <NUM_CLIENTS>`
Number of clients to use in snarkOS. Defaults to 2.

## `leo execute`
[Back to Top](#commands)
:::tip

:::

To execute a Leo transition function with inputs from the command line.
`<INPUTS>` should be a list of inputs to the program separated by spaces.
```bash
leo execute <TRANSITION> <INPUTS>
```
This command synthesizes the program circuit and generates proving and verifying keys.


```bash title="console output:"

```

:::info
The `-b` or `--broadcast` flag is required in order to broadcast a transaction to a network.
:::

:::info

:::

The command can be used to add an already deployed program as a project dependency.
`<PROGRAM>` should be the name of the program to add as a dependency.

```

See [Dependency Management](./04_dependencies.md) for more details.

&nbsp;

## `leo remove`
[Back to Top](#commands)

&nbsp;

## `leo run`
[Back to Top](#commands)
:::tip
Use this command to run your program before [**executing**](#leo-execute) it.
:::

To run a Leo transition function with inputs from the command line.
`<INPUTS>` should be a list of inputs to the program separated by spaces.
```bash
leo run <TRANSITION> <INPUTS>
```
This command does not synthesize the program circuit or generate proving and verifying keys.

For the default program created by `leo new`, this command
```bash
leo run main 1u32 2u32
```
will generate this output

```bash title="console output:"
 Leo ‚úÖ Compiled 'main.leo' into Aleo instructions

‚õì  Constraints
 ‚Ä¢ 'hello.aleo/main' - 33 constraints (called 1 time)

‚û°Ô∏è  Output
 ‚Ä¢ 3u32
 
 Leo ‚úÖ Finished 'hello.aleo/main' (in "/hello/build")
```

If one or more of your inputs are negatives, and consequently begin with a `-`,
you may separate the inputs with a `--` so that the command line parser
won't attempt to parse them as options:
```bash
leo run <TRANSITION_NAME> -- <INPUT_1> -- <INPUT_2> ...
```

&nbsp;
