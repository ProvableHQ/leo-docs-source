# `leo synthesize`

This command is used to generate proving and verifying keys for all transitions in a local or remote Leo program, along with circuit metadata.

```bash
leo synthesize <PROGRAM_NAME> --save <SAVE_DIRECTORY>
```

Each output of this command includes:
- Number of public inputs
- Number of variables
- Number of constraints
- Non-zero entries in matrices
- Circuit ID
- Proving and verifying keys saved to disk

This enables better understanding of program size and key management.
