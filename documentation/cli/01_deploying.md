The `leo deploy` command is used for deploying Leo program to a local devnet, Testnet, or Mainnet.
The `leo upgrade` command is used for upgrading an existing Leo program on the network.

## Getting Started
From the root of the Leo program directory, run the following command:
```bash
leo deploy --help
```
This will display the help message with all available options for the `leo deploy` command.
```bash
Deploy a program

## A Quick Example
When you run `leo new`, it creates a new Leo project with default files and directories, including a `.env` file.
The defaults in the `.env` file are set to deploy on a testnet devnet using a local node API endpoint.
The defaults are set to deploy on a local devnet with the `testnet` configuration using a local node API endpoint.

To test the deployment, run a devnet via `leo devnet` (you'll need to configure it appropriately and run it in a separate terminal) and then run:
```bash
> leo deploy  --devnet --broadcast
       Leo

       Leo     2 statements after dead code elimination.

Leo will:
- Compile the program and generate the necessary AVM instructions.
- Tell you the program's checksum, which is a unique identifier for the program's code.
- Display a deployment summary, including the total number of variables and constraints.
- Ask for confirmation before proceeding with the deployment.
- Broadcast the deployment transaction to the specified network.
- Wait for the transaction to be confirmed and display the transaction ID.

## Upgrading a Program

If your program is already deployed, you can upgrade it using the `leo upgrade` command.
The upgrade will only work if your program is upgradable, meaning it has a constructor that allows for upgrades.
See the [Upgradability Guide](../guides/03_program_upgradability.md) for more details on how to make your program upgradable.


## Options and Environment Variables
The target network, the Private Key, and a node API endpoint need to be specified for a deployment or upgrade.
They can be set in one of the following ways, in order of precedence:
1. CLI options,
2. environment variables, or
3. 3 `.env` file:

The options are selected in that order of precedence. 
For example, if the `--network` option is specified, it will override the value in the `.env` file.
A `.env` file should be formatted as follows:
```bash
NETWORK=testnet
PRIVATE_KEY=APrivateKey1z...GPWH
ENDPOINT=https://api.explorer.provable.com/v1
```

If you are deploying to a local devnet, use the `--devnet` flag.
