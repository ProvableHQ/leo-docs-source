Upgrades a program that is already deployed on the network.

See the **[Upgrading Programs](./../guides/10_program_upgradability.md)** guide for more details.


### Flags:

#### `--private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>`
Specifies the private key to use for the deployment. Overrides any `$PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable set manually or in a `.env` file.

#### `--network <NETWORK>`
Specifies the network to deploy to. Overrides any `NETWORK` environment variable set manually or in a `.env` file.  Valid network names are `testnet`, `mainnet`, and `canary`.


#### `--endpoint <ENDPOINT>`
The endpoint to deploy to. Overrides any `ENDPOINT` environment variable set manually or in a `.env` file.

**Common Endpoints:**

| Network |  Endpoint  |
|:---------:|:------:|
| Devnet (local)  | https://localhost:3030 | 
| Testnet  | https://api.explorer.provable.com/v1| 
| Mainnet  | https://api.explorer.provable.com/v1| 


#### `--devnet`
Specifies whether the network being deployed to is a devnet. If not set, defaults to the `DEVNET` environment variable.

:::info
This flag requires a devnet to be running locally.  See INSERT DEVNET GUIDE HERE for more information
:::


#### `-print`
Prints the transaction to the terminal/stdout in JSON format.

#### `-broadcast`
Broadcasts the transaction to the network upon successful execution.  Without passing this flag, the transaction will just be generated locally.

#### `--save <SAVE>`
Saves the transaction to the directory located at the `<SAVE>` path.

#### `-y`
#### `--yes`
The CLI will ask for manual confirmation on several steps throughout the deployment process.  Setting this flag automatically agrees to all confirmations.

:::warning
Do not use this feature unless you know what you are doing!
:::

#### `--priority-fees <PRIORITY_FEES>`
Specifes the priority fee for the deployment transaction(s) delimited by `|` and used in order. The fees are in microcredits and must either be valid `u64` or `default`. Defaults to 0.

:::tip
1 Credit == 1,000,000 Microcreditss
:::


#### `-f <FEE_RECORDS>`
#### `--fee-records <FEE_RECORDS>`

Specifes the record(s) to pay for fees privately, delimited by `|` and used in order. The fees must either be valid plaintext, ciphertext, or `default`.  If not specified, then transaction fees will be public.


#### `--consensus-heights <CONSENSUS_HEIGHTS>`
Specifies the consensus heights to use, delimited by `,`. This should only be set if you are using a custom devnet.

The following will enable Consensus_V0 at block 0, Consensus_V1 at block 1, etc.:
```bash
--consensus-heights 0,1,2,3....
```


#### `--consensus-version <CONSENSUS_VERSION>`
Specifies the consensus version to use. If one is not provided, the CLI will attempt to determine it from the latest block.

#### `--max-wait <MAX_WAIT>`
Specifies the number of seconds to wait for a block to appear when searching for a transaction. Defaults to 8 seconds.

#### `--blocks-to-check <BLOCKS_TO_CHECK>`
Specifies the number of blocks to look at when searching for a transaction.  Defaults to 12 blocks

```
Options:
--base-fees <BASE_FEES>
  [UNUSED] Base fees in microcredits, delimited by `|`, and used in order. The fees must either be valid `u64` or `default`. Defaults to automatic calculation.

--disable-conditional-branch-type-checking
    Disable type checking of nested conditional branches in finalize scope.
--enable-initial-ast-snapshot
