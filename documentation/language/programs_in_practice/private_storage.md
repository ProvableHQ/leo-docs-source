## Records

A [record](https://developer.aleo.org/concepts/fundamentals/records) data type is the method of encoding private state on Aleo.  Records are declared as `record {name} {}`. A record name must not contain the keyword `aleo`, and must not be a prefix of any other record name.

Records contain component declarations `{visibility} {name}: {type},`. Names of record components must not contain the keyword `aleo`.  The visibility qualifier may be specified as `constant`, `public`, or `private`. If no qualifier is provided, Leo defaults to `private`.

Record data structures must always contain a component named `owner` of type `address`, as shown below. When passing a record as input to a program function, the `_nonce: group` and `_version: u8` components are also required but do not need to be declared in the Leo program. They are inserted automatically by the compiler.

```aleo showLineNumbers
record Token {
    // The token owner.
    owner: address,
    // The token amount.
    amount: u64,
}
```
