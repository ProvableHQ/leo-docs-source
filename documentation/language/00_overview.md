### Statically Typed

Leo is a **statically typed language**, which means we must know the type of each variable before executing a circuit.

### Explicit Types Required

Leo does not support `undefined` or `null` values.  When creating a new variable, its type must be either:

- **Explicitly stated** using a type annotation, or  
- **Automatically inferred** by the compiler.  


<!-- The exception to this rule is when a new variable inherits its type from a previous variable. -->

### Pass by Value

Expressions in Leo are always **passed by value**, which means their values are always copied when they are used as
function inputs or in right sides of assignments.
