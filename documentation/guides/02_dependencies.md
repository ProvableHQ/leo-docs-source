Leo programs can import functionality from other programs.  Any imported programs are referred to as dependencies.  There are two types of dependencies:

- **Network dependencies**: Programs already deployed on the Aleo network, fetched as pre-compiled bytecode.
- **Local dependencies**: Code on your filesystem; either Leo code compiled from source, or Aleo Instructions code.

## Adding Dependencies

### Network Dependencies

To add a program already deployed on the Aleo network as a dependency:
```bash
leo add credits.aleo --network
```
or
```bash
leo add credits --network
```

For mainnet dependencies:
```bash
leo add credits --network mainnet
```

This adds an entry to your `program.json`:
```json
{
  "program": "your_program.aleo",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "name": "credits.aleo",
      "location": "network",
      "network": "testnet",
      "path": null
    }
  ]
}
```

### Local Dependencies

To add a Leo package or Aleo Instructions file from your local filesystem as a dependency:
```bash
leo add my_library.aleo --local ./path/to/my_library
```

This records the path in `program.json`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "name": "my_library.aleo",
      "location": "local",
      "network": null,
      "path": "./path/to/my_library"
    }
  ]
}
```

Local dependencies are compiled from source whenever you build. They never require network access.

### Removing Dependencies
```bash
leo remove credits.aleo
```

## Using Dependencies in Code

In your `main.leo`, import dependencies before the program declaration:
```leo
import credits.aleo;
import my_library.aleo;

program my_program.aleo {
    // ...
}
```

## Dependency Resolution Process

When you run a Leo command, dependencies are resolved as follows:

1. **Read `program.json`** to find declared dependencies
2. **For each dependency:**
   - **Local**: Read the Leo source from the specified path and compile it, or use Aleo Instructions file
   - **Network**: Fetch the bytecode from the Aleo network (or cache)
3. **Resolve transitive dependencies** - if your dependency imports other programs, those are fetched too
4. **Topologically sort** all programs so dependencies are processed before dependents

### Caching Behavior

Network dependencies are cached locally at `~/.aleo/registry/{network}/{program_name}/{edition}/` to avoid repeated downloads.

Different commands handle caching differently:

| Command | Cache Behavior |
|---------|---------------|
| `leo build` | Uses cache |
| `leo run` | Uses cache |
| `leo execute` | Always fetches fresh |
| `leo deploy` | Always fetches fresh |
| `leo upgrade` | Always fetches fresh |
| `leo synthesize` | Always fetches fresh |

Commands that generate proofs (`execute`, `deploy`, `upgrade`, `synthesize`) always fetch fresh bytecode because proofs include commitments to the exact bytecode of dependencies. Using stale cached bytecode would produce invalid proofs if a dependency has been upgraded on-chain.

To force a fresh fetch during `build` or `run`:
```bash
leo build --no-cache
```

## Program Editions

An **edition** is the version number of a deployed program on the Aleo network:
- **Edition 0:** Initial deployment
- **Edition 1:** First upgrade
- **Edition 2:** Second upgrade
- ...and so on

By default, Leo fetches the **latest** edition of a network dependency. To pin to a specific edition:
```bash
leo add some_program.aleo --edition 3
```

This records the pinned edition in the manifest:
```json
{
  "name": "some_program.aleo",
  "location": "network",
  "network": "testnet",
  "path": null,
  "edition": 3
}
```

**When to pin editions:**
- When you need reproducible builds
- When a dependency upgrade would break your program
- When you want to avoid unexpected behavior changes

**Note:** Local dependencies don't have editions - they're always compiled from your current source code.

## Deploying Programs with Dependencies

### Recursive Deployment

When deploying a program that has local dependencies, use:
```bash
leo deploy --recursive
```

This deploys all local dependencies in topological order, then deploys your main program. Dependencies already deployed on-chain are skipped.

### Network Dependencies at Deploy Time

When you deploy, Leo fetches fresh bytecode for all network dependencies to ensure your deployment transaction references the current on-chain editions. If a network dependency is at edition 0 and lacks a constructor (required since the V8 consensus upgrade), Leo will error with a clear message explaining that the dependency needs to be upgraded on-chain first.
