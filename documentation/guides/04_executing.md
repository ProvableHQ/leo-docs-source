The `leo execute` command executes the Leo program and outputs a transaction object
```bash
leo execute <FUNCTION_NAME> <INPUT_1> <INPUT_2> ...
```

Optionally, you can execute a function in a remote Leo program by using
```bash
leo execute <PROGRAM_NAME>.aleo/<FUNCTION_NAME> <INPUT_1> <INPUT_2> ...
```

If executing a function from a local program, the `leo execute` command will first build/compile that program:

```bash title="console output:"
       Leo     2 statements before dead code elimination.
       Leo     2 statements after dead code elimination.
       Leo     The program checksum is: '[212u8, 91u8, ... , 107u8]'.
       Leo ✅ Compiled 'hello.aleo' into Aleo instructions.

```
It will then print out the summary of the execution plan with 
```bash

Finally, an execution cost breakdown will be printed alongside any outputs from the function itself.
```bash

Under the hood, `leo execute` produces a JSON object. This is a [`Transaction`](https://developer.aleo.org/concepts/fundamentals/transactions) that can be broadcast to the Aleo network.  You can view this JSON by passing the `--print` flag to `leo execute`.
