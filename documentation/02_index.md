While a deep dive through the Leo documentation is a useful exercise, we realize that it may not be very pratical. To help you along your journey, we've provided a "map" to help you find your way.

## Recipes

- If you're brand new to Leo, go to **Getting Started** and make your way through **Hello, Leo**.

- If you're designing a dApp, we recommend checking out **Leo By Example** for a reference.

- If you're interested in advanced concepts, check out **Concepts** and **Recipes**. Be sure to check out the **Core Aleo Concepts**.


- If you're deploying or running your programs, **CLI** will be helpful.


## Overview

- **Getting Started.** Install, set up your development environment, and get familiar with Leo.

- **Language.** The syntax and semantics.

- **CLI.** Utilities that will help you build, deploy, and execute Leo programs. Includes other helpful utilities.

- **Testing.** The testing ecosystem for Leo programs.

- **Recipies.** Programming patterns you should keep in your toolbox.

- **Concepts.** Build your mental model of Leo and the underlying programming paradigm.

- **Resources.** How to get involved with the community and supplemental material.

- **SDK.** Productionize your Leo program.

- **Provable API.** Endpoints to query and interact with `mainnet` and `testnet`.
