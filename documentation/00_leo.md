# What's new on Leo?
### [**üì¶ Releases**](./https://github.com/ProvableHQ/leo/releases) - Stay up to date with the latest Leo releases.
### [**ü§ù Leo Core Developers Call**](./resouces/leocoredevs.md) - Collaborate with the Leo development team and ecosystem on the future of Leo.
### [**‚öõÔ∏è Create Leo App**](./sdk/create-leo-app/01_create_leo_app.md) - A full stack application written in Typescript using Leo and React.
:::

Leo is an open-source, statically-typed, imperative programming language designed for building private applications on the Aleo blockchain. 
It abstracts the complexities of zero-knowledge cryptography, enabling developers to create secure, privacy-preserving applications while abstracting technical complexities.

### Key Features 
- Intuitive Syntax: Influenced by languages like JavaScript and Rust, Leo offers a familiar and readable syntax, making it accessible to a wide range of developers.
- Seamless Aleo Integration: Specifically designed for the Aleo blockchain, Leo ensures smooth deployment and management of applications within Aleo's zero-knowledge ecosystem.
- Robust Tooling: Leo provides a comprehensive suite of tools, including a command-line interface and integrated development environment (IDE) plugins for Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text 3, and IntelliJ, enhancing the developer experience.
- Formal Verification: With a formally defined language structure, Leo enables developers to perform formal verification of their programs, ensuring correctness and security in application logic.


## Where to go from here?

While a deep dive through the Leo documentation is a useful exercise, we realize that it may not be very pratical. To help you along your journey, we've provided a "map" to help you find your way.

### Roadmap

- If you're brand new to Leo, go to **Getting Started** and make your way through **Hello, Leo**.

- If you're designing a dApp, we recommend checking out **Leo By Example** for a reference.

- If you're interested in advanced concepts, check out **Concepts** and **Recipes**. Be sure to check out the **Core Aleo Concepts**.

- If you're deploying or running your programs, **CLI** will be helpful.


### Overview

- **Getting Started.** Install, set up your development environment, and get familiar with Leo.

- **Language.** The syntax and semantics.

- **CLI.** Utilities that will help you build, deploy, and execute Leo programs. Includes other helpful utilities.

- **Testing.** The testing ecosystem for Leo programs.

- **Recipies.** Programming patterns you should keep in your toolbox.

- **Concepts.** Build your mental model of Leo and the underlying programming paradigm.

- **Resources.** How to get involved with the community and supplemental material.

- **SDK.** Productionize your Leo program.

- **Provable API.** Endpoints to query and interact with `mainnet` and `testnet`.
