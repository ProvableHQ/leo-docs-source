While a deep dive through the Leo documentation is a useful exercise, we realize that it may not be very pratical. To help you along your journey, we've provided a "map" to help you find your way.

## Roadmap

- If you're brand new to Leo, go to **Getting Started** and make your way through **Hello, Leo**.

- If you're designing a dApp, we recommend checking out **Leo By Example** for a reference.

- If you're interested in advanced concepts, check out **Concepts** and **Recipes**. Be sure to check out the **Core Aleo Concepts**.

- If you're deploying or running your programs, **CLI** will be helpful.
